# Tensorflow Workshop
**7.11.2018 - 19.12.2018**

Deep learning crash course with Alphamoon assistance.
Learning path is divided into several modules:

1. Data preparation
2. Building deep neural network in *Tensorflow*
3. Loss function, evaluation metrics & regularization
4. Optimizers
5. Training process
6. Results analysis & deployment

Every module is developed in Python using **Google Colab**, which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.
